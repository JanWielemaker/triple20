This document describes Triple20. Triple20 is a visualisation and 
editing tool for data stored in the SWI-Prolog <EM>semweb</EM> triple 
store. Triple20 has been designed not to limit the expressiveness of the 
triple data model, to scale comfortably to several millions of triples 
and deal with triples associated to multiple sources at the same time.

<P>As the internal interfaces stabelise they will be fixated and 
documented, providing an extensible toolkit whose components can be 
reorganised to build dedicated semantic web tools.

<P>Based completely on XML/RDF and fairly crash-proof the system is 
usable as visualisation and editing tool. Both is internal interfaces 
and UI however are under active development and change frequently, which 
is why we only explain the basics in this document.

<H2><A NAME="sec:1">1 Introduction</A></H2>

<P>Most ontology editors have their own view on the world that dictate 
both the internal data model and the UI. Such systems provide import and 
export filters to other formats. Triple20 on the contrary uses RDF/XML 
and the RDF formal triple data model <EM>directly</EM>, providing a 
range of visualization primitives that interpret the triple store at 
different level of abstraction ranging from access to the RDF/XML source 
via triple-tables and RDF diagrams to dedicated RDFS and OWL views. 
Using triples directly, these views can co-exist in the same application 
and the toolkit can easily handle anything that can be expressed in 
triples.

<P>Modularity and scale are other important aspects of the semantic web. 
Triple20 keeps track of the source of each triple which enables it it 
view and edit several RDF documents in a unified view. It has been 
designed to view and edit models with several millions of triples on 
standard office equipment.

<H2><A NAME="sec:2">2 The Triple20 User Interface</A></H2>

<P>The interface is too unstable to document in any detail. This section 
only provides some hints to get you started.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.1">2.1 Drag till you Drop</A></H3>

<P>Many edit operations require two arguments, making drag-and-drop an 
attractive interface technique. Drag and drop is associated with most 
objects on both the left- and right mouse button. While dragging, the 
system indicates the action taken in the status window. On left-drag it 
executes the indicated action. On right-drop it displays a menu with 
alternatives. Some actions

<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Reorganise the hierarchy</I><BR>
The hierarchy in the left window can be reorganised using drag-and-drop. 
This can be used to modify the class hierarchy, property hierarchy and 
to change the type of instances.

<P>
<LI><I>Change property values</I><BR>
Objects can be dropped on property values in the table to change the 
value of a property. When an object is dropped on a predicate a new 
value is added. Dropping a predicate on a predicate changes the 
relation. Predicates can also be dropped on the khaki coloured
<B>Predicates</B> title bar to add a new predicate to the current 
subject.
</UL>

<P>Note that <A HREF="#menu:File/Newwindow">File/New window</A> creates 
a new view on the triple set that fully cooperates and synchronises with 
the other views. Drag and drop between multiple views is a suggested 
technique to deal with larger ontologies. Notable the user can exploit 
search in a small window to locate relevant resources.

<P>If the text-field is coloured blue, this indicates there is at least 
one resource in the database that exactly matches the typed string.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.2">2.2 Context menus</A></H3>

<P>Most objects have a context menu associated with the right 
mouse-button that act on the represented resource, possibly in relation 
to other resources on the same row (table) or related in the hierarchy. 
Sub-menus are described as <B>Menu/SubMenu/...</B>

<DL>

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Details"><STRONG>Details</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Show the resource in the table and bring the most applicable view to the 
front.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Hierarchylocation"><STRONG>Hierarchy location</STRONG></A> (<VAR>table</VAR>)<DD>
If the resource is not in the hierarchy, add it as well as the parents 
to create (an arbitrary) path to the root. See also <A HREF="#menu:View/Showallparents">View/Show all parents</A>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Copy/Id"><STRONG>Copy/Id</STRONG></A><DD>
Put the full resource identifier (including namespace) on the clipboard.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Copy/Copyasxmlidentifier"><STRONG>Copy/Copy as xml 
identifier</STRONG></A><DD>
Put the <VAR>NamespaceId</VAR>:<VAR>LocalId</VAR> on the clipboard using 
the namespace identifier as registered with the <CODE>rdf_db</CODE> 
library.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Copy/Copyasxmlattribute"><STRONG>Copy/Copy as xml 
attribute</STRONG></A><DD>
Put the resource in a format suitable for an XML attribute value:
&amp;<VAR>NamespaceId</VAR>;<VAR>LocalId</VAR>

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Renameresource"><STRONG>Rename resource</STRONG></A><DD>
Rename an existing resource to a new one. All triples holding the old 
resource in either of the three fields are updated.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Delete"><STRONG>Delete</STRONG></A><DD>
Delete a resource completely. All triples holding this resource in 
either of the three fields are removed from the database.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Deleteclasshierarchy"><STRONG>Delete class hierarchy</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Delete an entire hierarchy build using <CODE>rdfs:subClassOf</CODE> or a 
subproperty thereof. Resources that become disconnected from the 
hierarchy are deleted completely.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Unrelate"><STRONG>Unrelate</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Delete the triple causing the node to appear in this location of the 
hierarchy. All other relations are unaffected. See also
<A HREF="#menu:View/Showallparents">View/Show all parents</A>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Newsubclass"><STRONG>New subclass</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Create a new resource and make it a subclass of the current node. The 
create dialog prompts for the file, namespace and label for the new 
resource. The meta class (<CODE>rdf:type</CODE>, default associated file 
and default namespace are the same as the super class.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Newindividual"><STRONG>New individual</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Create an individual of the class represented by the current node. See 
also <A HREF="#menu:Newsubclass">New subclass</A>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Newproperty"><STRONG>New property</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Create an individual of the property class represented by the current 
node. See also <A HREF="#menu:Newsubclass">New subclass</A>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/rdfsource"><STRONG>View/rdf source</STRONG></A><DD>
Open the RDF description defining the resource. The current 
implementation na&iuml;vely opens the first if triples for the resource 
originate from multiple descriptions.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/diagram"><STRONG>View/diagram</STRONG></A><DD>
Open an RDF diagram with this resource or add this resource to the 
already open diagram. The current diagram window is based on code from 
an older project and not yet well integrated into Triple20.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/Showallparents"><STRONG>View/Show all parents</STRONG></A> (<VAR>hierarchy</VAR>)<DD>
Find all places in the hierarchy where the current resource appears and 
highlight them. This is particularly useful to examine multiple 
inheritance, multiple types, etc.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/triples"><STRONG>View/triples</STRONG></A> (<VAR>predicate</VAR>)<DD>
Show all triples of this predicate in the right-hand table. The current 
triple-table is crude, providing inefficient update and poor handling of 
large tables.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.3">2.3 The Window menu</A></H3>

<DL>

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Newwindow"><STRONG>File/New window</STRONG></A><DD>
Create a new Triple20 window on the same database. Drag and drop between 
the two windows is supported to relate resources from different parts of 
the hierarchy.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Openproject"><STRONG>File/Open project</STRONG></A><DD>
Discard the current database and open an existing project (see
<A HREF="#sec:project">section 5</A>). Triple20 cannot work with 
multiple projects at the same time.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Newproject"><STRONG>File/New project</STRONG></A><DD>
Discard the current database and create a new empty project. See
<A HREF="#sec:project">section 5</A> for details on working with 
projects.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Loadontology"><STRONG>File/Load ontology</STRONG></A><DD>
Load triples from an XML/RDF file. Note that most XML/RDF files depend 
on RDFS and/or OWL, which must be loaded to get a meaningful view. See 
also <A HREF="#menu:File/Loadbaseontology">File/Load base ontology</A>. 
If Triple20 is started by opening an XML/RDF file it will apply some 
heuristics to load the required base ontologies. Use <B>File/Statistics</B> 
to examine the loaded files.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Loadbaseontology"><STRONG>File/Load base ontology</STRONG></A><DD>
Load one of the ontologies distributed with triple20. Almost any project 
requires <CODE>rdfs</CODE>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Newfile"><STRONG>File/New file</STRONG></A><DD>
Create a new file and add it to the pool. After creating this file 
resources can be associated to it. See also <A HREF="#menu:Newsubclass">New subclass</A> 
and <A HREF="#sec:files">section 5.1</A> for a discussion on file 
management.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Mergefiles"><STRONG>File/Merge files</STRONG></A><DD>
Move the triples associated with a file to another file. The command 
opens a dialog for selecting the source and destination files. For 
example, ontologies can be merged by creating a new file, merging the 
desired ontologies into the new file and save this file.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Savefile"><STRONG>File/Save file</STRONG></A><DD>
The submenu holds all loaded files, where the files whose set of 
associated triples has been modified are activated. The `modified' state 
is based on the MD5 hash of the triples associated to the file which 
implies that after <EM>edit/undo</EM> or <EM>edit/inverse edit</EM> the 
file is still regarded unmodified.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Saveall"><STRONG>File/Save all</STRONG></A><DD>
Save all modified files.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Namespaces"><STRONG>File/Name spaces</STRONG></A><DD>
Inspect/edit the mapping from short name space identifiers (e.g. <EM>rdfs</EM>) 
to the associated URI. Changes to this mapping are stored in the 
project.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/Files"><STRONG>File/Files</STRONG></A><DD>
Show loaded files, associated namespaces and access rights. Second tab 
shows some query statistics.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:File/exit"><STRONG>File/exit</STRONG></A><DD>
Exit the current window. Note that the current Triple20 runs on top of 
the Prolog toplevel which may be used to inspect and alter the triple 
store. Closing a window does not stop Prolog. New Triple20 windows can 
be created from Prolog using the command <CODE>?- go.</CODE>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/Label"><STRONG>View/Label</STRONG></A><DD>
Change the labels displayed for resources. See <A HREF="#sec:label">section 
2.5</A> for details.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/Dialect"><STRONG>View/Dialect</STRONG></A><DD>
Change which part of and how the triple store is interpreted. Little of 
this is implemented in the current prototype.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/OWL/Classextension"><STRONG>View/OWL/Class 
extension</STRONG></A><DD>
If selected (default), resources that belong to the dynamically computed 
class extension are visible in the hierarchy with the
<IMG SRC="think.gif"> icon. Note that computing the OWL class extension 
is very incomplete.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:View/Showroots/..."><STRONG>View/Show roots/...</STRONG></A><DD>
The submenu shows all source files. Selecting a source file collapses 
the hierarchy and then adds all concepts and properties that are defined 
in this file, but whose parent is not defined in this file. The file to 
which a resource belongs is defined as the file to which the <CODE>rdf:type</CODE> 
triple belongs.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Tools/Addmissinglabels"><STRONG>Tools/Add missing 
labels</STRONG></A><DD>
Add an <CODE>rdfs:label</CODE> triple to each non-anonymous resource 
that has no defined label. The default label is the local name of the 
resource.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Tools/Maintenance/Deletecachedontologies"><STRONG>Tools/Maintenance/Delete 
cached ontologies</STRONG></A><DD>
Delete all cache files created to speedup the loading of RDF/XML files. 
This may be necessary to recover from incompatible changes to the cache 
file format or bugs in the RDF/XML parser.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Tools/Maintenance/Deletesnapshots"><STRONG>Tools/Maintenance/Delete 
snapshots</STRONG></A><DD>
Delete all snapshots. If you want to preserve any project file, make 
sure you understand snapshots before using this option. See
<A HREF="#sec:snapshots">section 5.3</A>.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Help/Help"><STRONG>Help/Help</STRONG></A><DD>
Open this document in your browser.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Help/About"><STRONG>Help/About</STRONG></A><DD>
Show the about box. Among author and copyright information it provides a 
link to the project home.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.4">2.4 Search</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:search"></A>

<P>The top-right window allows searching resources with certain literal 
properties. The <B>Search in</B> menu specifies the properties searched. 
Two entries have special meaning.

<DL>

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Any"><STRONG>Any</STRONG></A><DD>
Search in any property with literal value. Searching for <EM>Any</EM> 
disables the other fields.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="menu:Resource"><STRONG>Resource</STRONG></A><DD>
Search the resource itself.
</DL>

<P>The search-field itself allows for the syntax <EM>ns:string</EM>, 
where
<EM>ns</EM> is a namespace abbreviation. This causes the search to be 
executed in the given namespace only.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.5">2.5 Icons and Labels</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:label"></A>

<P>Using the <A HREF="#menu:View/Label">View/Label</A> menu the system 
can identify resources in three ways. <EM>Label only</EM> only displays 
the label. The label is either the first value for the <CODE>rdfs:label</CODE> 
property, a subproperty thereof or the last part of the resource name. <EM>Namespace 
and label</EM> displays the namespace identifier (see <A HREF="#sec:namespaces">section 
5.2</A>) before the label. This is the default. <EM>Resource</EM> 
displays the namespace identifiers in front of the local resource name.

<P>In most situations the label is preceded by a small icon. The icons 
depend on the classification of the resource. In the hierarchy view, 
labels may have two icons. In this case the first icon represents the 
relation to the parent and the second represents the type 
classification.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.6">2.6 Undo and redo</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 provides unlimited undo and redo using toolbar buttons. Note 
however that some operations, notably file merge

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.7">2.7 View consistency</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 uses the <EM>Model-View-Controller</EM> design. Edit 
operations only modify the triple database. The GUI monitors the changes 
to the triple database and updates the display. Unfortunately the view 
has a very indirect relation to the triples. Generally labels register 
themselves to be updated whenever a property of the represented resource 
is changed, added or deleted. Complicates relations such as expressed in 
the hierarchy and table use a registered <EM>query</EM> which is 
re-evaluated on every change in the background. If the result changes 
the background thread triggers the UI to update.

<P>This deals with most changes, but sometimes the system will miss the 
proper update. When in doubt collapse and re-expand the hierarchy and/or 
switch the table to another resource and back to force proper update. 
Please report inconsistencies you think can be avoided.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.8">2.8 Printing</A></H3>

<P>There is very limited support to print graphical representations. The 
main tool has a <EM>Print hierarchy</EM> menu, which prints the current 
expansion of the left hierarchy window on a single sheet of paper. The <EM>RDF 
graph viewer</EM>, started with <EM>View diagram</EM> also provides a 
print option.

<P>Note that not only the visible part of the window, but also the 
invisible parts are printed. The result is scaled down to fit a single 
page.

<H2><A NAME="sec:3">3 Semantic Web practice</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:practice"></A>

<H3><A NAME="sec:3.1">3.1 Classes as property values</A></H3>

<P>A very common modeling practice is to use classes as property values. 
For example, people are tempted to describe the colour of an object as
<EM>red</EM> by selecting the class <EM>red</EM> from a colour ontology. 
A commonly seen mistake is to define a property colour with its range 
set to the root of the colour hierarchy of the domain ontology. This 
construct however allows for <EM>individuals</EM> of colours to be 
placed in the property, not <EM>subclasses</EM>. The W3C best practices 
group's current position on this issue is to fill the property with an
<EM>anonymous individual</EM> of the class, in our case an anonymous 
individual of class <EM>red</EM>. At first this may appear odd, but 
think about it. The colour of an object is not `red', but some
<EM>unspecified</EM> form of this colour! Representation as an anonymous 
individual is a clean solution to express this.

<P>Triple20 supports this practice by creating an anonymous individual 
whenever one tries to define a property where the value is a subclass of 
the range of the property. Such objects are identified with the
<IMG SRC="anon.gif"> icon.

<H2><A NAME="sec:4">4 OWL support</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:owl"></A>

<P>The current version of Triple20 does not know much about OWL. It 
supports OWL at the following places:

<P><UL COMPACT>
<LI><I>Restriction labels</I><BR>
All instances of class <CODE>owl:Restriction</CODE> can be accessed in 
the hierarchy below the class node. Restriction that have an anonymous 
resource have a dedicated label that clearly visualizes its contents. If <B>OWL/Class extension</B> 
is active (default) it shows the resources that satisfy the restriction 
prefixed by the
<IMG SRC="think.gif"> icon.

<P>
<LI><I>OWL Descriptions</I><BR>
It also shows a special icon and (if the resource is anonymous) 
dedicated label for OWL descriptions. Descriptions visualise the class 
extension as restrictions described above.

<P>
<LI><I>Subclass</I><BR>
The hierarchy displays, in addition to <CODE>rdfs:subClassOf</CODE>, the 
reverse of <CODE>owl:intersectionOf</CODE>.

<P>
<LI><I>Inferred properties</I><BR>
The property table shows additional properties inferred prefixed by the <IMG SRC="think.gif"> 
icon. To suppress this feature, switch the dialect to RDFS.
</UL>

<P>OWL reasoning uses a subset of OWL/Full, inferring properties that 
can be inferred fairly quickly. Supported reasoning includes:
<CODE>owl:sameAs</CODE> and the property attributes <CODE>owl:inverseOf</CODE>,
<CODE>owl:SymmetricProperty</CODE> and <CODE>owl:TransitiveProperty</CODE>. 
It also derives the value of a property if one of the types of a 
resource defines <CODE>owl:hasValue</CODE>.

<P>Triple20 deduces the class extensions of restrictions and 
descriptions. If property values are to be considered it uses the above 
described features to infer property values.

<H2><A NAME="sec:5">5 Projects and files</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:project"></A>

<H3><A NAME="sec:5.1">5.1 Files</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:files"></A>

<P>Triples in <EM>rdf_db</EM> are actually quadruples. The last part 
registers the origin of the triple, so the tool can load ontologies from 
multiple files, present the joined view and still save the modified 
triples to a specific file. As Triple20 provides an integrated view and 
editing capabilities on all triples loaded from all sources it requires 
some machinery and defaults to define the source assigned to newly 
created triples. The <B>File/Statistics</B> menu gives access to an 
overview of the loaded files and allows to inspect and edit properties 
thereof. Defined properties are:

<DL>

<P>
<DT><B>ro</B><DD>
The source is read only. Any transaction that modifies this source is 
rolled back and an error message is displayed. Sources are initially 
flagges as <CODE>ro</CODE> if they are loaded as a <EM>base ontology</EM> 
or they are loaded from a read-only file.

<P>
<DT><B>rw</B><DD>
The source is editable. This implies triples can deleted, updated and 
added. If no source is flagged <CODE>all</CODE>, new triples are added 
to the same source as already existing triples on the same subject. New 
subjects are ---by default--- added to the same source as their <EM>context</EM>, 
but this may be overruled by the user.

<P>
<DT><B>fallback</B><DD>
If there is no context, this source is used for new triples. At most one 
of the sources has the <CODE>fallback</CODE> or <CODE>all</CODE> 
property. Enabling <CODE>fallback</CODE> or <CODE>all</CODE> enables <CODE>rw</CODE>.

<P>
<DT><B>all</B><DD>
All new triples are added to this source.
</DL>

<P>The menu <A HREF="#menu:File/Mergefiles">File/Merge files</A> allow 
the user to move all triples associated to some file to another file. 
This can be used to merge ontologies. The <A HREF="#menu:File/Savefile">File/Save file</A> 
submenu allow for saving modified files. The <A HREF="#menu:View/Showroots/...">View/Show roots/...</A> 
submenu can be used to show the roots of classes and properties defined 
on a file.

<H3><A NAME="sec:5.2">5.2 Namespaces</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:namespaces"></A>

<P>Triple20 has an internal table of well-known namespaces and their 
common abbreviation. This table is in the file <CODE>rdf_base.pl</CODE>. 
If possible it will use the abbreviated form in the UI. Namespaces can 
be added through the <A HREF="#menu:File/Namespaces">File/Names paces</A> 
menu option. Registered namespaces are stored in the project file.

<H3><A NAME="sec:5.3">5.3 Project files and snapshots</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:snapshots"></A>

<P>A <EM>project file</EM> <CODE>.rdfj</CODE> is a <EM>journal</EM> of 
executed edit operations. This approach has several advantages over the 
normal load-modify-save cycle.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ontology files can be very large. Managing a journal of actions 
provides space and time performance benefits.

<P>
<LI>A journal protects the user from loosing work due to crashes or 
other malfunctioning of experimental software.

<P>
<LI>A journal provides an excellent starting point for advanced version 
management as well as studying user behaviour.
</UL>

<P>There are various alternatives for handling the loading of ontology 
files in the journal. One is to simply add the fact that a file is 
loaded. This can be attractive because the journal acts as a set of edit 
operations that can be executed on a modified version of the same file. 
Unfortunately it also easily leads to problems if the file is saved from 
the tool. For this reason Triple20 maintains a <EM>snapshot</EM> 
directory where it stores snapshots of ontology files loaded into 
projects. The name for these files is created from the original file as 
well as an MD5 digest constructed from the triples. The journal contains 
information on the original file (name, time modified, size, number of 
triples) as well as the MD5 digest. If the journal is replayed it will 
first try to locate the snapshot from the MD5 digest and name, loading 
exactly the same file. If this fails Triple20 tries to locate the 
ontology file itself.

<H2><A NAME="sec:6">6 Triple20 as a library</A></H2>

<P>Triple20 can be used in two modes: as a stand-alone applicationn and 
as a Prolog library. <A HREF="#sec:install">Section 7</A> discusses 
installation as a stand-alone executable. This section discusses the 
steps to use Triple20 as a GUI in another Prolog program. This usage 
aims at non-GUI RDF applications based on the <CODE>library(rdf_db.pl)</CODE> 
library that wish to have a GUI for exploring the triple-set. Note that 
it is possible to load and Triple20 only in a debugging version.

<H3><A NAME="sec:6.1">6.1 Making Triple20 known</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 uses the file-search path <CODE>triple20</CODE> for locating 
its components. Add the following to your project load-file, adjusting 
the path to reflect local installation:

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN=center BORDER=6 BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><TR><TD NOWRAP>
<PRE>

:- multifile
        user:file_search_path/2.
:- dynamic
        user:file_search_path/2.

user:file_search_path(triple20, '/staff/jan/src/Triple20/src').
</PRE>
</TABLE>

<P>Now, Triple20 can be loaded using the directive

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN=center BORDER=6 BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><TR><TD NOWRAP>
<PRE>

:- use_module(triple20(load)).
</PRE>
</TABLE>

<H3><A NAME="sec:6.2">6.2 Interacting with Triple20</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 provides the following predicates:

<DL>

<P>
<DT><A NAME="triple20/1"><STRONG>triple20</STRONG>(<VAR>+Argv</VAR>)</A><DD>
Start the Triple20 GUI using options from <VAR>Argv</VAR>. <VAR>Argv</VAR> 
is a list of atoms, each atom providing a commandline argument.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="triple20/0"><STRONG>triple20</STRONG></A><DD>
Equivalent to <CODE>triple20([])</CODE>, starting the default Triple20 
GUI.

<P>
<DT><A NAME="t20/1"><STRONG>t20</STRONG>(<VAR>+Action</VAR>)</A><DD>
Utility predicate telling the Triple20 GUI to perform some action. It 
uses the broadcasting service to send a message to all open Triple20 GUI 
windows. Typical actions are:

<DL>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>refresh</STRONG><DD>
Propagate changes to the database to Triple20. Normally Triple20 gets 
update messages from the <CODE>library(rdf_edit.pl)</CODE> library. 
Applications using <CODE>library(rdf_db.pl)</CODE> directly should 
inform Triple20 that the database has changes, forcing Triple20 to flush 
its caches.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>open_resource</STRONG>(<VAR>+URI, +How</VAR>)<DD>
Open resource <VAR>URI</VAR> according to <VAR>How</VAR> in the <CODE>table</CODE> 
or <CODE>hierarchy</CODE>.
</DL>

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="sec:7">7 Downloading and Installation</A></H2>

<A NAME="sec:install"></A>

<P>The current snapshot of the Triple20 toolkit can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.swi-prolog.org/cvs.html">SWI-Prolog CVS server</A>. 
As the system is under active development, the <EM>HEAD</EM> revision is 
often unstable. We use the symbolic (sticky) tag <EM>STABLE</EM> to 
reflect the latest usable version. The CVS download commands are:

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN=center BORDER=6 BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><TR><TD NOWRAP>
<PRE>

% cvs -d :pserver:pl@gollem.science.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl login
Logging in to :pserver:pl@gollem.science.uva.nl:2401/usr/local/cvspl
CVS password: prolog

% cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:pl@gollem.science.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl co -r STABLE Triple20
</PRE>
</TABLE>

<P>This command both downloads the software and the basic ontologies. 
Alternatively you may checkout the CVS module <B>Triple20-Full</B>, 
which also download RDF versions of
<A HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.opencyc.org/">OpenCyc</A> and
<A HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/">SUMO</A> (total <VAR>&#177;</VAR>&nbsp;47&nbsp;Mb).

<H3><A NAME="sec:7.1">7.1 Finishing in MS-Windows</A></H3>

<P>After installing Prolog, double click <CODE>setup.bat</CODE> to 
register
<CODE>.RDFJ</CODE> project files to start Triple20. Optionally also 
associate <CODE>.RDF</CODE>, <CODE>.RDFS</CODE> and <CODE>.OWL</CODE> to 
lauch Triple20 and load the file.

<P>To make Triple20 accessible from the Windows desktop, create a
<EM>shortcut</EM> from the desktop to <CODE>src/triple20.pl</CODE> or 
write a .BAT file by adjusting the template given below.

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN=center BORDER=6 BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><TR><TD NOWRAP>
<PRE>

@echo off

"C:\Program Files\pl\bin\plwin.exe" "C:\Program Files\Triple20\src\triple20.pl"
</PRE>
</TABLE>

<H3><A NAME="sec:7.2">7.2 Finishing in Unix</A></H3>

<P>Edit <CODE>triple20.pl</CODE>, adjust <CODE>#!</CODE> path to point 
to the SWI-Prolog executable and <A NAME="idx:filesearchpath2:1"></A><B>file_search_path/2</B> 
with an absolute path to the directory where you installed the sources. 
Now copy (or make a symbolic link) triple20.pl to a directory in your <CODE>$PATH</CODE> 
environment variable as <CODE>triple20</CODE>.

<P>After this you can run <CODE>triple20 option ... file ...</CODE>. 
Using
<CODE>triple20 --help</CODE> for a list of commandline options.

<H2><A NAME="sec:8">8 Bugs and other issues</A></H2>

<P>Although the current system is in active use for browsing ontologies 
for some time and the first users start to edit ontologies with it, it 
should first of all be regarded as a prototype. Some remaining issues 
are:

<P><UL COMPACT>
<LI><I>File handling</I><BR>
Viewing and controlling the association of triples to files needs to be 
improved. In addition we need ways to package and tranfer project files 
which depends on one or more snapshots.

<P>
<LI><I>Search</I><BR>
We need an advanced search dialog to specify complex searches for 
resources.

<P>
<LI><I>OWL</I><BR>
The current system provides a simple subset of OWL/Full for deducing 
property values and computing class extensions. More reasoning must be 
provided, as well as the possibility to tailure the used inferencing.

<P>
<LI><I>Update</I><BR>
Some scheduling and visual feedback is required to deal with maintaining 
the UI consistency on large ontologies using background computing. We 
also need to destroy unused cached queries to free up memory.

<P>
<LI><I>Tables</I><BR>
The table controller suffers some layout problems.

<P>
<LI><I>Extensibility</I><BR>
The internal interfaces must be cleaned and documented to allow users to 
modify the visualization rule-set and extend the tool.
