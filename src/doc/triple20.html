<H2><A NAME="sec:1">1 Introduction</A></H2>

<P>Triple20 is a toolkit for visualization and editing of data in the
<CODE>library(rdf_db)</CODE> <EM>triple store</EM>.

<H2><A NAME="sec:2">2 The Triple20 User Interface</A></H2>

<P>The interface is too unstable to document in any detail. This section 
only provides some hints to get you started.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.1">2.1 Drag till you Drop</A></H3>

<P>Many edit operations require two arguments, making drag-and-drop an 
attractive interface technique. Drag and drop is associated with most 
objects on both the left- and right mouse button. While dragging, the 
system indicates the action taken in the status window. On left-drag it 
executes the indicated action. On right-drop it displays a menu with 
alternatives. Some actions

<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Reorganise the hierarchy</I><BR>
The hierarchy in the left window can be reorganised using drag-and-drop. 
This can be used to modify the class hierarchy, property hierarchy and 
to change the type of instances.

<P>
<LI><I>Change propterty values</I><BR>
Objects can be dropped on property values in the table to change the 
value of a property. When an object is dropped on a predicate a new 
value is added. Dropping a predicate on a predicate changes the 
relation.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.2">2.2 Context menus</A></H3>

<P>Most objects have a context menu associated with the right 
mouse-button.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.3">2.3 Icons and Labels</A></H3>

<P>Using the <B>View/Label</B> menu the system can identify resources in 
three ways. <EM>Label only</EM> only displays the label. The label is 
either the first value for the <CODE>rdfs:label</CODE> property, a 
subproperty thereof or the last part of the resource name. <EM>Namespace 
and label</EM> displays the namespace identifier (see <A HREF="#sec:namespaces">section 
3.2</A>) before the label. This is the default. <EM>Resource</EM> 
displays the namespace identifiers in front of the local resource name.

<P>In most situations the label is preceded by a small icon. The icons 
depend on the classification of the resource. In the hierarchy view, 
labels may have two icons. In this case the first icon represents the 
relation to the parent and the second represents the type 
classification.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.4">2.4 Undo and redo</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 provides unlimited undo and redo using toolbar buttons.

<H3><A NAME="sec:2.5">2.5 View consistency</A></H3>

<P>Triple20 uses the <EM>Model-View-Controller</EM> design. Edit 
operations only modify the triple database. The GUI monitors the changes 
to the triple database and updates the display. Unfortunately the view 
has a very indirect relation to the triples. Generally labels register 
themselves to be updated whenever a property of the represented resource 
is changed, added or deleted. Complicates relations such as expressed in 
the hierarchy and table use a registered <EM>query</EM> which is 
re-evaluated on every change in the background. If the result changes 
the background thread triggers the UI to update.

<P>This deals with most changes, but sometimes the system will miss the 
proper update. When in doubt collapse and re-expand the hierarchy and/or 
switch the table to another resource and back to force proper update. 
Please report inconsistencies you think can be avoided.

<H2><A NAME="sec:3">3 Projects and files</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="sec:3.1">3.1 Files</A></H3>

<P>Triples in <EM>rdf_db</EM> are actually quadruples. The last part 
registers the origin of the triple, so the tool can load ontologies from 
multiple files, present the joined view and still save the modified 
triples to a specific file. If a new class or instance is created using 
the <B>New ...</B> context menu in the hierachy the system allows to 
specify the file using the file of the parent as default. If properties 
are added to a subject these are added in the same file as the <CODE>rdf:type</CODE> 
property of the subject or ---if this property is not present--- to the 
file of the first property found.

<P>The menu <B>File/Merge files</B> allow the user to move all triples 
associated to some file to another file. This can be used to merge 
ontologies.

<P>The <B>File/Save file</B> submenus allow for saving modified files.

<H3><A NAME="sec:3.2">3.2 Namespaces</A></H3>

<A NAME="sec:namespaces"></A>

<P>Triple20 has an internal table of well-known namespaces and their 
common abbreviation. This table is in the file <CODE>rdf_base.pl</CODE>. 
If possible it will use the abbreviated form in the UI. Namespaces can 
be added through the <B>File/Namespaces</B> menu option. Registered 
namespaces are stored in the project file.

<H3><A NAME="sec:3.3">3.3 Project files and snapshots</A></H3>

<P>A <EM>project file</EM> <CODE>.rdfj</CODE> is a <EM>journal</EM> of 
executed edit operations. This approach has several advantages over the 
normal load-modify-save cycle.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ontology files can be very large. Managing a journal of actions 
provides space and time performance benefits.

<P>
<LI>A journal protects the user from loosing work due to crashes or 
other malfunctioning of experimental software.

<P>
<LI>A journal provides an excelent starting point for advanced version 
management as well as studying user behaviour.
</UL>

<P>There are various alternatives for handling the loading of ontology 
files in the journal. One is to simply add the fact that a file is 
loaded. This can be attractive because the journal acts as a set of edit 
operations that can be executed on a modified version of the same file. 
Unfortunately it also easily leads to problems if the file is saved from 
the tool. For this reason Triple20 maintains a <EM>snapshot</EM> 
directory where it stores snapshots of ontology files loaded into 
projects. The name for these files is created from the original file as 
well as an MD5 digest constructed from the triples. The journal contains 
information on the original file (name, time modified, size, number of 
triples) as well as the MD5 digest. If the journal is replayed it will 
first try to locate the snapshot from the MD5 digest and name, loading 
exactly the same file. If this fails Triple20 tries to locate the 
ontology file itself.

<H2><A NAME="sec:4">4 Downloading and Installation</A></H2>

<P>The current snapshot of the Triple20 toolkit can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.swi-prolog.org/cvs.html">SWI-Prolog CVS server</A>. 
As the system is under active development, the <EM>HEAD</EM> revision is 
often unstable. We use the symbolic (sticky) tag <EM>STABLE</EM> to 
reflect the latest useable version. The CVS download commands are:

<P><P><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN=center BORDER=6 BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><TR><TD NOWRAP>
<PRE>

% cvs -d :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl login
Logging in to :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:2401/usr/local/cvspl
CVS password: prolog

% cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl co -r STABLE Triple20
</PRE>
</TABLE>

<P>This command both downloads the software and the basic ontologies. 
Alternatively you may checkout the CVS module
<B>Triple20-Full</B>, which also download RDF versions of
<A HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.opencyc.org/">OpenCyc</A> and
<A HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/">SUMO</A> (total <VAR>&#177;</VAR>&nbsp;47&nbsp;Mb).

<H3><A NAME="sec:4.1">4.1 Finishing in MS-Windows</A></H3>

<P>After installing Prolog, double click <CODE>src/setup.pl</CODE> to 
register
<CODE>.RDFJ</CODE> project files to start Triple20. Optionally also 
associate <CODE>.RDF</CODE>, <CODE>.RDFS</CODE> and <CODE>.OWL</CODE> to 
lauch Triple20 and load the file.

<P>To make Triple20 accessible from the Windows desktop, create a
<EM>shortcut</EM> from the desktop to <CODE>src/triple20.pl</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="sec:4.2">4.2 Finishing in Unix</A></H3>

<P>Edit <CODE>triple20.pl</CODE>, adjust <CODE>#!</CODE> path to point 
to the SWI-Prolog executable and <A NAME="idx:filesearchpath2:1"></A><B>file_search_path/2</B> 
with an absolute path to the directory where you installed the sources. 
Now copy (or make a symbolic link) triple20.pl to a directory in your <CODE>$PATH</CODE> 
environment variable as <CODE>triple20</CODE>.

<P>After this you can run <CODE>triple20 option ... file ...</CODE>. 
Using
<CODE>triple20 --help</CODE> for a list of commandline options.
