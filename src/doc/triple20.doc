\begin{abstract}
This document describes Triple20.  Triple20 is a visualisation and
editing tool for data stored in the SWI-Prolog \emph{semweb} triple
store.  Triple20 has been designed not to limit the expressiveness
of the triple data model, to scale comfortably to several millions
of triples and deal with triples associated to multiple sources at
the same time.

As the internal interfaces stabelise they will be fixated and
documented, providing an extensible toolkit whose components can be
reorganised to build dedicated semantic web tools.

Based completely on XML/RDF and fairly crash-proof the system is
usable as visualisation and editing tool. Both is internal interfaces
and UI however are under active development and change frequently, which
is why we only explain the basics in this document.

\section{Introduction}

Most ontology editors have their own view on the world that dictate both
the internal data model and the UI. Such systems provide import and
export filters to other formats. Triple20 on the contrary uses RDF/XML
and the RDF formal triple data model \emph{directly}, providing a range
of visualization primitives that interpret the triple store at different
level of abstraction ranging from access to the RDF/XML source via
triple-tables and RDF diagrams to dedicated RDFS and OWL views. Using
triples directly, these views can co-exist in the same application and
the toolkit can easily handle anything that can be expressed in triples.

Modularity and scale are other important aspects of the semantic web.
Triple20 keeps track of the source of each triple which enables it it
view and edit several RDF documents in a unified view.  It has been
designed to view and edit models with several millions of triples on
standard office equipment.

\section{The Triple20 User Interface}

The interface is too unstable to document in any detail.  This section
only provides some hints to get you started.

\subsection{Drag till you Drop}

Many edit operations require two arguments, making drag-and-drop an
attractive interface technique.  Drag and drop is associated with most
objects on both the left- and right mouse button.  While dragging, the
system indicates the action taken in the status window.  On left-drag
it executes the indicated action.  On right-drop it displays a menu with
alternatives.  Some actions

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Reorganise the hierarchy]
The hierarchy in the left window can be reorganised using drag-and-drop.
This can be used to modify the class hierarchy, property hierarchy and
to change the type of instances.

    \item [Change property values]
Objects can be dropped on property values in the table to change the
value of a property.  When an object is dropped on a predicate a new
value is added.  Dropping a predicate on a predicate changes the
relation. Predicates can also be dropped on the khaki coloured
\textbf{Predicates} title bar to add a new predicate to the current
subject.
\end{itemlist}

Note that \menuref{File/New window} creates a new view on the triple set
that fully cooperates and synchronises with the other views. Drag and
drop between multiple views is a suggested technique to deal with larger
ontologies. Notable the user can exploit search in a small window to
locate relevant resources.


\subsection{Context menus}

Most objects have a context menu associated with the right mouse-button
that act on the represented resource, possibly in relation to other
resources on the same row (table) or related in the hierarchy. Sub-menus
are described as \textbf{Menu/SubMenu/...}

\begin{description}
    \menuitem{Details}{hierarchy}
Show the resource in the table and bring the most applicable view to the
front.

    \menuitem{Hierarchy location}{table}
If the resource is not in the hierarchy, add it as well as the parents
to create (an arbitrary) path to the root. See also \menuref{View/Show
all parents}.

    \menuitem{Copy/Id}{}
Put the full resource identifier (including namespace) on the clipboard.

    \menuitem{Copy/Copy as xml identifier}{}
Put the \arg{NamespaceId}:\arg{LocalId} on the clipboard using the
namespace identifier as registered with the \file{rdf_db} library.

    \menuitem{Copy/Copy as xml attribute}{}
Put the resource in a format suitable for an XML attribute value:
\&\arg{NamespaceId};\arg{LocalId}

    \menuitem{Rename resource}{}
Rename an existing resource to a new one.  All triples holding the old
resource in either of the three fields are updated.

    \menuitem{Delete}{}
Delete a resource completely.  All triples holding this resource in
either of the three fields are removed from the database.

    \menuitem{Delete class hierarchy}{hierarchy}
Delete an entire hierarchy build using \const{rdfs:subClassOf} or a
subproperty thereof.  Resources that become disconnected from the
hierarchy are deleted completely.

    \menuitem{Unrelate}{hierarchy}
Delete the triple causing the node to appear in this location of the
hierarchy. All other relations are unaffected. See also
\menuref{View/Show all parents}.

    \menuitem{New subclass}{hierarchy}
Create a new resource and make it a subclass of the current node. The
create dialog prompts for the file, namespace and label for the new
resource. The meta class (\const{rdf:type}, default associated file and
default namespace are the same as the super class.

    \menuitem{New individual}{hierarchy}
Create an individual of the class represented by the current node.  See
also \menuref{New subclass}.

    \menuitem{New property}{hierarchy}
Create an individual of the property class represented by the current
node. See also \menuref{New subclass}.

    \menuitem{View/rdf source}{}
Open the RDF description defining the resource. The current
implementation na\"\i{}vely opens the first if triples for the resource
originate from multiple descriptions.

    \menuitem{View/diagram}{}
Open an RDF diagram with this resource or add this resource to the
already open diagram.   The current diagram window is based on code
from an older project and not yet well integrated into Triple20.

    \menuitem{View/Show all parents}{hierarchy}
Find all places in the hierarchy where the current resource appears
and highlight them.  This is particularly useful to examine multiple
inheritance, multiple types, etc.

    \menuitem{View/triples}{predicate}
Show all triples of this predicate in the right-hand table.  The
current triple-table is crude, providing inefficient update and
poor handling of large tables.
\end{description}


\subsection{The Window menu}

\begin{description}
    \menuitem{File/New window}{}
Create a new Triple20 window on the same database.  Drag and drop
between the two windows is supported to relate resources from different
parts of the hierarchy.

    \menuitem{File/Open project}{}
Discard the current database and open an existing project (see
\secref{project}).  Triple20 cannot work with multiple projects at the
same time.

    \menuitem{File/New project}{}
Discard the current database and create a new empty project.  See
\secref{project} for details on working with projects.

    \menuitem{File/Load ontology}{}
Load triples from an XML/RDF file.  Note that most XML/RDF files depend
on RDFS and/or OWL, which must be loaded to get a meaningful view.  See
also \menuref{File/Load base ontology}. If Triple20 is started by opening
an XML/RDF file it will apply some heuristics to load the required base
ontologies.  Use \menuref{File/Statistics} to examine the loaded files.

    \menuitem{File/Load base ontology}{}
Load one of the ontologies distributed with triple20. Almost any project
requires \const{rdfs}.

    \menuitem{File/New file}{}
Create a new file and add it to the pool.  After creating this file
resources can be associated to it.  See also \menuref{New subclass}
and \secref{files} for a discussion on file management.

    \menuitem{File/Merge files}{}
Move the triples associated with a file to another file.   The command
opens a dialog for selecting the source and destination files. For
example, ontologies can be merged by creating a new file, merging
the desired ontologies into the new file and save this file.

    \menuitem{File/Save file}{}
The submenu holds all loaded files, where the files whose set of
associated triples has been modified are activated.  The `modified'
state is based on the MD5 hash of the triples associated to the file
which implies that after \emph{edit/undo} or \emph{edit/inverse edit}
the file is still regarded unmodified.

    \menuitem{File/Save all}{}
Save all modified files.

    \menuitem{File/Name spaces}{}
Inspect/edit the mapping from short name space identifiers (e.g.\
\emph{rdfs}) to the associated URI.  Changes to this mapping are
stored in the project.

    \menuitem{File/Statistics}{}
Show statistics on the triples loaded from and associated to each file
as well as some query statistics.

    \menuitem{File/exit}{}
Exit the current window.  Note that the current Triple20 runs on top
of the Prolog toplevel which may be used to inspect and alter the
triple store.  Closing a window does not stop Prolog.  New Triple20
windows can be created from Prolog using the command \exam{?- go.}.

    \menuitem{View/Label}{}
Change the labels displayed for resources.  See \secref{label}
for details.

    \menuitem{View/Dialect}{}
Change which part of and how the triple store is interpreted.  Little
of this is implemented in the current prototype.

    \menuitem{View/OWL/Class extension}{}
If selected (default), resources that belong to the dynamically computed
class extension are visible in the hierarchy with the
\includegraphics[width=2ex]{think} icon. Note that computing the OWL
class extension is very incomplete.

    \menuitem{Tools/Add missing labels}{}
Add an \const{rdfs:label} triple to each non-anonymous resource that has
no defined label.  The default label is the local name of the resource.

    \menuitem{Tools/Maintenance/Delete cached ontologies}{}
Delete all cache files created to speedup the loading of RDF/XML files.
This may be necessary to recover from incompatible changes to the cache
file format or bugs in the RDF/XML parser.

    \menuitem{Tools/Maintenance/Delete snapshots}{}
Delete all snapshots.  If you want to preserve any project file, make
sure you understand snapshots before using this option. See
\secref{snapshots}.

    \menuitem{Help/Help}{}
Open this document in your browser.

    \menuitem{Help/About}{}
Show the about box.  Among author and copyright information it provides
a link to the project home.
\end{description}


\subsection{Icons and Labels}			\label{sec:label}

Using the \menuref{View/Label} menu the system can identify resources in
three ways.  \emph{Label only} only displays the label.  The label is
either the first value for the \const{rdfs:label} property, a subproperty
thereof or the last part of the resource name.  \emph{Namespace and label}
displays the namespace identifier (see \secref{namespaces}) before the
label.  This is the default.  \emph{Resource} displays the namespace
identifiers in front of the local resource name.

In most situations the label is preceded by a small icon. The icons
depend on the classification of the resource. In the hierarchy view,
labels may have two icons. In this case the first icon represents the
relation to the parent and the second represents the type
classification.


\subsection{Undo and redo}

Triple20 provides unlimited undo and redo using toolbar buttons. Note
however that some operations, notably file merge 


\subsection{View consistency}

Triple20 uses the \emph{Model-View-Controller} design. Edit operations
only modify the triple database.  The GUI monitors the changes to the
triple database and updates the display.  Unfortunately the view has
a very indirect relation to the triples.  Generally labels register
themselves to be updated whenever a property of the represented
resource is changed, added or deleted.  Complicates relations such
as expressed in the hierarchy and table use a registered \emph{query}
which is re-evaluated on every change in the background.  If the result
changes the background thread triggers the UI to update.

This deals with most changes, but sometimes the system will miss the
proper update. When in doubt collapse and re-expand the hierarchy and/or
switch the table to another resource and back to force proper update.
Please report inconsistencies you think can be avoided.


\section{OWL support}				\label{sec:owl}

The current version of Triple20 does not know much about OWL.  It supports
OWL at the following places:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item [Restriction labels]
All instances of class \const{owl:Restriction} can be accessed in the
hierarchy below the class node.  Restriction that have an anonymous
resource have a dedicated label that clearly visualizes its contents.
If \menuref{OWL/Class extension} is active (default) it shows the
resources that satisfy the restriction prefixed by the
\includegraphics[width=2ex]{think} icon.

    \item [OWL Descriptions]
It also shows a special icon and (if the resource is anonymous)
dedicated label for OWL descriptions.  Descriptions visualise the
class extension as restrictions described above. 

    \item [Subclass]
The hierarchy displays, in addition to \const{rdfs:subClassOf},
the reverse of \const{owl:intersectionOf}.

    \item [Inferred properties]
The property table shows additional properties inferred prefixed by
the \includegraphics[width=2ex]{think} icon.  To suppress this feature,
switch the dialect to RDFS.
\end{shortlist}

OWL reasoning uses a subset of OWL/Full, inferring properties that can
be inferred fairly quickly. Supported reasoning includes:
\const{owl:sameAs} and the property attributes \const{owl:inverseOf},
\const{owl:SymmetricProperty} and \const{owl:TransitiveProperty}. It
also derives the value of a property if one of the types of a resource
defines \const{owl:hasValue}.

Triple20 deduces the class extensions of restrictions and descriptions.
If property values are to be considered it uses the above described
features to infer property values.


\section{Projects and files}			\label{sec:project}

\subsection{Files}				\label{sec:files}

Triples in \emph{rdf_db} are actually quadruples. The last part
registers the origin of the triple, so the tool can load ontologies from
multiple files, present the joined view and still save the modified
triples to a specific file.  As Triple20 provides an integrated view
and editing capabilities on all triples loaded from all sources it 
requires some machinery and defaults to define the source assigned
to newly created triples.  The \menuref{File/Statistics} menu gives
access to an overview of the loaded files and allows to inspect and
edit properties thereof.  Defined properties are:

\begin{description}
    \item [ro]
The source is read only. Any transaction that modifies this source is
rolled back and an error message is displayed. Sources are initially
flagges as \const{ro} if they are loaded as a \emph{base ontology}
or they are loaded from a read-only file.

    \item [rw]
The source is editable.  This implies triples can deleted, updated
and added.  If no source is flagged \const{all}, new triples are
added to the same source as already existing triples on the same
subject.  New subjects are ---by default--- added to the same source
as their \emph{context}, but this may be overruled by the user.

    \item [fallback]
If there is no context, this source is used for new triples.  At most
one of the sources has the \const{fallback} or \const{all} property.
Enabling \const{fallback} or \const{all} enables \const{rw}.

    \item [all]
All new	triples are added to this source.
\end{description}

The menu \menuref{File/Merge files} allow the user to move all triples
associated to some file to another file.  This can be used to merge
ontologies.

The \menuref{File/Save file} submenus allow for saving modified files.


\subsection{Namespaces}				\label{sec:namespaces}

Triple20 has an internal table of well-known namespaces and their common
abbreviation.  This table is in the file \file{rdf_base.pl}.  If possible
it will use the abbreviated form in the UI.  Namespaces can be added through
the \menuref{File/Names paces} menu option. Registered namespaces are
stored in the project file.


\subsection{Project files and snapshots}	\label{sec:snapshots}

A \emph{project file} \fileext{rdfj} is a \jargon{journal} of executed
edit operations.  This approach has several advantages over the normal
load-modify-save cycle.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ontology files can be very large.  Managing a journal of actions
          provides space and time performance benefits.

    \item A journal protects the user from loosing work due to crashes or
          other malfunctioning of experimental software.

    \item A journal provides an excellent starting point for advanced 
          version management as well as studying user behaviour.
\end{itemize}

There are various alternatives for handling the loading of ontology
files in the journal. One is to simply add the fact that a file is
loaded. This can be attractive because the journal acts as a set of edit
operations that can be executed on a modified version of the same file.
Unfortunately it also easily leads to problems if the file is saved from
the tool. For this reason Triple20 maintains a \jargon{snapshot}
directory where it stores snapshots of ontology files loaded into
projects.  The name for these files is created from the original file
as well as an MD5 digest constructed from the triples.  The journal
contains information on the original file (name, time modified, size,
number of triples) as well as the MD5 digest. If the journal is replayed
it will first try to locate the snapshot from the MD5 digest and name,
loading exactly the same file.  If this fails Triple20 tries to locate
the ontology file itself.


\section{Downloading and Installation}

The current snapshot of the Triple20 toolkit can be downloaded from
\url[SWI-Prolog CVS server]{http://www.swi-prolog.org/cvs.html}.  As
the system is under active development, the \emph{HEAD} revision is
often unstable.	We use the symbolic (sticky) tag \emph{STABLE} to
reflect the latest usable version.  The CVS download commands are:

\begin{code}
% cvs -d :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl login
Logging in to :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:2401/usr/local/cvspl
CVS password: prolog

% cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:pl@gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl:/usr/local/cvspl co -r STABLE Triple20
\end{code}

This command both downloads the software and the basic ontologies.
Alternatively you may checkout the CVS module
\textbf{Triple20-Full}, which also download RDF versions of
\url[WordNet]{http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/},
\url[OpenCyc]{http://www.opencyc.org/} and
\url[SUMO]{http://suo.ieee.org/} (total $\pm$~47~Mb).

\subsection{Finishing in MS-Windows}

After installing Prolog, double click \file{setup.bat} to register
\fileext{RDFJ} project files to start Triple20.  Optionally 
also associate \fileext{RDF}, \fileext{RDFS} and \fileext{OWL} to
lauch Triple20 and load the file.

To make Triple20 accessible from the Windows desktop, create a
\emph{shortcut} from the desktop to \file{src/triple20.pl} or
write a .BAT file by adjusting the template given below.

\begin{code}
@echo off

"C:\Program Files\pl\bin\plwin.exe" "C:\Program Files\Triple20\src\triple20.pl"
\end{code}


\subsection{Finishing in Unix}

Edit \file{triple20.pl}, adjust \verb$#!$ path to point to the
SWI-Prolog executable and file_search_path/2 with an absolute path to
the directory where you installed the sources. Now copy (or make a
symbolic link) triple20.pl to a directory in your \verb!$PATH!
environment variable as \const{triple20}.

After this you can run \verb$triple20 option ... file ...$.  Using
\verb$triple20 --help$ for a list of commandline options.


\section{Bugs and other issues}

Although the current system is in active use for browsing ontologies
for some time and the first users start to edit ontologies with it, it
should first of all be regarded as a prototype.  Some remaining issues
are:

\begin{shortlist}
    \item [File handling]
Viewing and controlling the association of triples to files needs to
be improved.  In addition we need ways to package and tranfer project
files which depends on one or more snapshots.

    \item [Search]
We need an advanced search dialog to specify complex searches for
resources.

    \item [OWL]
The current system provides a simple subset of OWL/Full for deducing
property values and computing class extensions.  More reasoning must
be provided, as well as the possibility to tailure the used inferencing.

    \item [Update]
Some scheduling and visual feedback is required to deal with maintaining
the UI consistency on large ontologies using background computing. We
also need to destroy unused cached queries to free up memory.

    \item [Tables]
The table controller suffers some layout problems.

    \item [Extensibility]
The internal interfaces must be cleaned and documented to allow users
to modify the visualization rule-set and extend the tool.
\end{shortlist}
