---+ Triple20 TODO list

---++ Editing:

	* Obligatory slots: add to create-node
	* Rules defined specification of the `new' dialog.  See
	  rdf_tree.
		* Which triples to add?
			* Similar to drag-and-drop
		* Hierarchy: which node/role to create?
			* Can we do that using the hierarchy roles

---++ Plugin infrastructure:

	* Finish SKOS plugin.  Document it.
	* Specifying plugins:

		| Global	| Plugins |
		| User		| ~/.t20/Plugins |
		| Local		| .t20/Plugins |

==
<t20:Plugin
  t20:source="..."
  t20:active="true">
</t20:Plugin>
==

---++ Settings
	* Namespace vizualization

---++ rdf_db

	* Add undo at low level?  Possibly can also be a plugin running
	  on top of rdf_monitor.  Replace rdf_edit
	* Index by source to speedup saving individual sources
	* C-based fuzzy individual match.  Fuzzy hash-function?
	* Interval indexing.

---++ rdf_diagram

	* Undo visual changes
	* Summarise long literals
	* Selectively expand relations
	* Allow `abstract' paths based on class/property abstraction.

---++ rdfs_class_sheet

	* Rule based viewing of displayed slots (can use same ruleset)
	  as diagram!
	
---++ MISC

	* Sort cache update to how long they take.  Update scheduling.
	* Slots with range rdfs:list, allow dropping a list to
	  replace the empty list instead of creating a list-of-lists
       
---++ VALIDATE

	* Warn on resources that end/start with blank space and other
	  non-canonical stuff (multiple spaces, tabs, newline).

---++ OWL

	* Finish DL reasoner

---++ QUERY

	* Result-set is (as in SeRQL) an RDF graph.
	* Specification of search slots, extented search syntax
	  (boolean expressions, namespaces, things similar to Anjo's
	  tOKo).
